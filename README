An apprenticeship tracking app built during my apprenticeship at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com).

It was an exercise in building with:
- TDD
- Sinatra
- Warden (authentication used by Devise)
- The Repository pattern to switch between:
-- In-Memory objects for testing and development
-- DataMapper and PosgreSQL for development and production
- Travis CI
