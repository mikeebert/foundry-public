Feature: Viewer creates an apprenticeship
  In order to create an apprenticeship
  As a user of the website
  I want to be able to set the information

  #Scenario: Fill out form
    #Given I am on "/apprenticeships/new"
    #When I fill in "start_date" with "05/12/1979"
    #And I fill in "end_date" with "05/13/1979"
    #And I select "One" from "apprentice_id"
    #And I select "Two" from "mentor_id"
    #Then I should see "You have created an apprenticeship starting on 1/1/2012 and ending 1/1/2013"
